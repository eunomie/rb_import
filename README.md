# rb_import

`rb_import` adds an `import` method to your Ruby VM that lets you
load a file that exposes a Ruby object. As long as the imported file
doesn't pollute the VM's constants table (ie: defines a constant),
the caller won't see any unwanted objects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rb_import'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rb_import

Alternatively, you can spawn a `pry` console right away by just running:

    $ rake console

## USAGE

```ruby
# foo.rb
Class.new do
  def bar
    "bar"
  end
end

# bar.rb
foo = import './foo.rb'
puts foo.new.bar # => outputs "bar"
```

See files in the `test` directory for examples.

## Is it any good?

[Yes](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434).

## Is It "Production Readyâ„¢"?

Yes. I guess.
